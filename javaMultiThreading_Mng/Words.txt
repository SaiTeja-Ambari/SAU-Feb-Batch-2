The Taj Mahal is known the world over for its beautiful
 architecture, history and the tale of love that led to its creation. Located in the Indian
 city of Agra, the Taj Mahal was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a testament of
 his love for his departed wife Mumtaz Mahal. Apart from housing her tomb, it also contains the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
 The mausoleum, built with an ivory-white marble and precious stones, was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
 To this day it attracts 7 to 8 million visitors a year. Also Read - From Chana Masala to Naan, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is Head Over Heels in Love with Indian Food
